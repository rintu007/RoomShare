# RoomShare
This is a website which helps you find not only flats but also roommates.
You can look for flat with/without roommates or if you are a person with flat then you can upload the pics of flats and find roommates.
The person gets suggessions based on his area, budget and all other factors and in a sorted order.
The order is decided by our "percent matching algorithm" which finds profile compatibility of user and the flat along with his roommate profiles based on his choices.
The match is found only if a person likes a flat and its occupants and the owner likes him back or vice versa.

# How to run this website
It's a PHP based website so you would need a local host i.e. apache server and a MySQL database or you can host it on the cloud.
Then open browser and type
localhost/RoomShare/home.html
This will open the home page of the website and it's pretty easy from there.
